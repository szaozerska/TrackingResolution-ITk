The package is written in Python 3.6.8

To run it in Jupyter Notebook: %run trackingerror.py

For instructions of using the code in a notebook, see 'example.ipynb'.

To run the package in terminal: 

python3 trackingerror.py [-h] [-f filename] [-p momentum] [-m mass] [-B MagneticField][-eta pseudorapidity][-verbose v]

e.g. in terminal run: python3 trackingerror.py -f example.txt

To see the help: python3 trackingerror.py -h

If you would like to produce plots directly from command line, you can call the plot() function in main(), within trackingerror.py. "plot" is a function of the file input, the error variable (i.e. 'sigma(d)'), the B field (default B = 2T), eta (default eta = 0) and the mass of the particle (default muon). By default it is commented out and the resolution numbers are printed only for the parameters passed by command line. Instead, if plot() is called, the resolution of the indicated parameter will be shown as a function of pT. If multiple instances of "plot" are called, the results will be overlaid in a single plot. See examples directly in the code. 

The supported layer configuration is solenoidal geometry (i.e. cylinder layers), with origin set at its center. 
xy plane denotes the transeverse plane. z-direction is in the direction of the cylinder axis.
All layers are assumed to be infinite long along z-axis.
Particle is assumed to be of unit charge e.

The units of output are:

	sigma(pt)/pt: no unit
	
	sigma(d): micrometer
	
	sigma(phi): radians
	
	sigma(z): micrometer
	
	sigma(theta): radians
	
About the input file: 
The "-f" option allows you to read from the detector configuration from a txt file, but the file must be in certain format:
	
	To comment out a line use "#".
	
	Each line is a layer configuration.
	
	The first column is the layer width (unit: radiation length X0).
	
	The second column is the detector resoluton in xy plane (unit: meter).
	
	The third column is the detector resolution in z direction (unit: meter).
	
	The final column is the layer position in the radial direction with respect to the origin (unit: meter).
	
	The order of the lines does not matter, but two layers with the same position must be avoided.

An example of input file format can be found in example.txt. This is just a placeholder with material thickness set at 0, equally spaced layers and same detector resolution in the longitudinal and radial directions. Some other detector layout options are also provided in .txt.

To change parameters from command line:

	-m M, --m M          mass of the particle in GeV/c^2 (default: muon mass)
	
  	-B B, --B B          magnetic field in T (default: 2T)
	
  	-eta ETA, --eta ETA  pseudorapidity (default: 0)
	
  	-p P, --p P          momentum of the particle in GeV/c (default: 1 GeV) (Note this is the total momentum)

Caveat: at least three layers are needed for a reasonable output.
